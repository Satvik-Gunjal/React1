        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>At zappos.com, our purpose is simple: to line and deliver WOW.</p>

        <p>
          Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold
          shoes. Today we still sell shoes --he company was founded in 1999 by
          Nick Swinmurn <br />
          and launched under the domain name Shoesite.com. In July 2009, Amazon
          acquired Zappos in an all-stock deal worth around $1.2 billion at the
          time. Amazon purchased <br />
          all of the outstanding shares and warrants from Zappos for 10 million
          shares of Amazon's common stock and provided $40 million in cash{" "}
          <br />
          and restricted stock for the Zappos employees. and the community in a
          long-term,sustainable way.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope that in future people won't even realised we startd selling
          shoes. insted they will konw zoppas as <br />
          service company that just happen to sell__________.
